## Installation

You'll need a working Java Runtime Environment for your system. I have JDK 17 installed on my Mac, so I will be linking to that version here
    - [Mac](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_macos-aarch64_bin.dmg)    - [Windows](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_windows-x64_bin.exe)

For Mac, run the disk image you just downloaded.

For Windows, run the executable you just downloaded.

## To Play

Once you've either cloned the repo or downloaded and unzipped the compressed files, open that directory in your favorite shell ( i use _`zsh`_) -- for you non-coders out there, your context window (right-click) will usually contain some sort of "open in terminal" option

1. compile the classes
   - `javac Rooms.class Wumpus.class`
2. run the game
   - `java Wumpus.java`
